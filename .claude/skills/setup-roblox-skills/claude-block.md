## Roblox Skills

This project uses the Roblox skill pack. Route requests through these skills instead of improvising.

### Golden rule: build in vertical slices

Do **not** try to build a whole game (or a whole system) in one pass — that is the main cause of half-broken Roblox games. Turn a concept into a PRD (`roblox-to-prd`), slice it into small playtestable pieces (`roblox-to-issues`), and build one slice at a time, verifying each in a Studio playtest before the next. Valuable state (currency, inventory, purchases, rewards, progression) is server-authoritative from the first slice.

### Always suggest the next skill

At the **end of every skill**, tell the user what to run next based on the lifecycle below and the skill's own `## Next` section — e.g. "Done. Next: run `roblox-playtest-qa` to verify, or `roblox-to-issues` to slice the follow-up work." Never leave the user guessing where they are in the lifecycle.

### Lifecycle map

Run roughly in this order; loop back as needed. Don't scale content until the core loop, mobile usability, save/security basics, and retention signals are credible.

`roblox-game-development-lifecycle` is the umbrella — use it for broad requests ("build a game", "what next?") to find the current phase and route.

### Where the code lives

The game's Luau code and instances live in the **Roblox cloud experience** and are edited through Studio MCP (`roblox-studio-workflow`) — they are **not stored in Git**. Git / the tracker holds only **planning artifacts**: `ROADMAP.md`, PRDs, slices, and UI design briefs. Never commit game code here, and never treat a Git checkout as the source of truth for the place — the cloud experience is.

### Project config

- **Tracker:** see `docs/agents/tracker.md`.
- **Triage labels:** see `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.
- **UI design artifacts:** see `docs/agents/design.md`.
- **Roadmap index:** `ROADMAP.md` — `[ ]` not started · `[~]` built & tested, awaiting approval · `[x]` built, playtested, and approved.
